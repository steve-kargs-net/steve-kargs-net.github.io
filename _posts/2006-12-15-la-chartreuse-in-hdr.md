[La Chartreuse in HDR](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsidez/114912908/) by [bsidez](http://www.flickr.com/people/bsidez/). </span>

I learned something new about photography while eating lunch today and [browsing flickr: ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsidez/sets/72057594077901710/detail/)[HDR](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bsidez/sets/72057594077901710/detail/). [HDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging) stands for [High Dynamic Range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging) and is a photography technique used to represent the wide range of intensity levels as can be seen by the human eye. It is normally done by shooting multiple exposures and then blending the exposures in a photo manipulation program like the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/). Some of the HDR photos I saw today are really stunning and colorful. A lot of the HDR images are just [tone mapped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping "Tone mapping") and look fake.

Although not necessarily the same as HDR, I sometimes fix a photograph using an exposure blending technique. I use a [Neutral Density filter gradient technique](http://www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/NDFilter/) in the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/). I would like to explore using HDR in my photography. Perhaps I will use [pfstools. pfstools are open source applications for reading, writing, manipulating and viewing high-dynamic range (HDR) images and video frames](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/pfstools/).
