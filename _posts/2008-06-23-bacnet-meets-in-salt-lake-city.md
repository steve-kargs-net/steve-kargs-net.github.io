The [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/) committee met in [Salt Lake City](http://www.visitsaltlake.com/visit/) at the end of June. We had a large number of Addenda that had finished public review, and had lots of comments for which to respond. Salt Lake City had some interesting sites and some street items that I had not seen before. The “Look” on the pavement, as well as the flags used at some crosswalks.

I attended Mass at [Cathedral of the Madeleine](http://www.saltlakecathedral.org/) on Saturday night. It was a beautiful church and a thought provoking sermon.

I ate some wonderful food in Salt Lake City, including a fabulous carrot cake at [Squatter’s Pub Brewery](http://www.squatters.com/ "Squatter's Pub Brewery"), and some delightful salmon at [Cucina Toscana](http://cucina-toscana.com/ "Cucina Toscana").
