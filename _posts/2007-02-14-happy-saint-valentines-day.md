I saw a fabulous photo today that speaks volumes on [Saint Valentines Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day) for Christian married couples. I found it while searching for [digital camera information](http://www.steves-digicams.com/) today. The photo was taken by <font face="arial,helvetica"><font face="arial,helvetica"><font face="verdana">[Frank Zaremba](mailto:f.zaremba@comcast.net). Thank you Frank for your creativity! Thank you God for blessing me with an [ideal wife](http://garden.kargs.net/)!</font></font></font>
