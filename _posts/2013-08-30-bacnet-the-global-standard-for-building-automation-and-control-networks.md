My friend and BACnet colleague, [Mike Newman](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-newman/6/566/1a8/), the father of [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/), recently finished writing a book about BACnet. [BACnet: The Global Standard for Building Automation and Control Networks](http://www.amazon.com/BACnet-Standard-Building-Automation-Sustainable/dp/1606502883/), was recently published and is for sale at Amazon. I havenâ€™t read the entire book yet, only portions of it while providing peer review for Mike, but it should be a fun and informative book to read.
