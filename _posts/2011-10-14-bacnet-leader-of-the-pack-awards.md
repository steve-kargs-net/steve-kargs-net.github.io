[BACnet International](http://www.bacnetinternational.org/) presented its annual “Leaders of the Pack” program to recognize the achievements of individuals and companies involved in the [BACnet ](http://www.bacnet.org/)community. The Award Ceremony took place during the 2011 Facility Decisions Conference &amp; Expo on October 11-12, 2011 in Las Vegas, NV.

I received one of the awards (although I wasn’t in Las Vegas), which was really unexpected. The full list of recipients is listed on the [BACnet International “Leaders of the Pack” website press release](http://www.bacnetinternational.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=206).

Pete Baselici was at the awards ceremony, so he received the award for me, and presented it to me when he returned.
