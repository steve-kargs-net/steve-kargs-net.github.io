Every once in awhile, I need a macro to work around a difference in a C compiler.

For example, not every compiler for the Win32 platform has implemented C99 integer and boolean types, so I have [stdint.h](http://bacnet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/bacnet/trunk/bacnet-stack/ports/win32/stdint.h) and [stdbool.h](http://bacnet.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/bacnet/trunk/bacnet-stack/ports/win32/stdbool.h) files. Fortunately, The Open Group maintains an online definition for [stdint.h](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/stdint.h.html) and [stdbool.h](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/stdbool.h.html) so I donâ€™t have to guess about what is supposed to go in there. C99 also defines some new keywords: `restrict`, `inline`, `_Complex`, `_Imaginary`, `_Bool`. Since `_Bool` is used by stdbool.h, it may or may not have been defined by the compiler. What I needed was a macro defined by the compiler that tells me which compiler it is so I can avoid compiler warnings.

Digging up the compiler macros on the internet can be challenging. However, there is a nice project at SourceForge to track [Pre-defined C/C++ Compiler Macros.](http://predef.sourceforge.net/)

That makes things a whole lot easier!
