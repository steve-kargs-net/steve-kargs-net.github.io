My daughter Anna got a book in December – How to Draw Fairies. I like to draw, so I studied it and began drawing a fairy using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/). Drawing scalable vector art that can be filled is different than sketching. After I got the sketching finished, I had to redraw most of it to make it fillable so that I could add colors.

I presented my handiwork to Anna. She told me that Tinkerbell’s wings were more blue, she needed a ribbon in her hair, and she had tassles or balls on her shoes. I guess I missed a few critical details. So back to the drawing board I went.

I had hoped to add this little gem to [Tux Paint](http://tuxpaint.org/), but I am not sure that I can since Tinkerbell is a [Disney](http://disney.com/) trademark image.
