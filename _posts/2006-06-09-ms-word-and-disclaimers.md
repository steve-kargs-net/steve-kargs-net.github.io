I was reading [Linux Magazine](http://www.linux-mag.com/) and came across a link to [<span class="i">Anonym.OS</span>](http://sourceforge.net/projects/anonym-os/). I followed the link to the [<span class="i">Anonym.OS</span> home page](http://kaos.to/cms/) and then to [Taylor Banks’ website](http://taylorbanks.com/) and eventually found [Jeff Goldmark’s website](http://www.goldmark.org/).

[Jeff writes net rants](http://www.goldmark.org/netrants/) about some things that bother me as well. He wrote one about [why you should not use MS-Word as a document exchange format](http://www.goldmark.org/netrants/no-word/attach.html). I use [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) for word processing and don’t have many problems opening MS-Word attachments. The MS-Word documents are mostly used for collaboration on the [BACnet](http://bacnet.org/) standard, and that is the format that we use.

He wrote another about [disclaimers that appear at the bottom of e-mail](http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/). I occasionally receive e-mail that has the disclaimer at the bottom. I guess they are silly, aren’t they?
