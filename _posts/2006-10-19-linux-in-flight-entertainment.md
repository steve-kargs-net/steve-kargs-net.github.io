[![Linux entertainment LCD touch screen in every headrest of a Song airline 757.](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/PDC_0190.thumbnail.JPG "Linux entertainment LCD touch screen in every headrest of a Song airline 757.")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/PDC_0190.JPG "Linux entertainment LCD touch screen in every headrest of a Song airline 757.")I traveled to Phoenix this week to give a [BACnet and Lighting Applications](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/BACnetAndLighting2006.pdf) presentation to the [NEMA](http://www.nema.org/) JSC on DALI. I flew there aboard a [Song Airlines](http://www.flysong.com/) 757. During the powerup sequence for the plane, all the passengers were greeted with the image of Tux and the [Linux](http://kernel.org/) boot sequence as the in-flight entertainment system in each headrest initialized. The touch panel color LCD screens provided games, movies, music, flight information, and satellite television. During the 3 hour flight, I watched [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/), [Mythbusters on Discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythbusters), [TLC](http://tlc.discovery.com/), and Sunday night football. I also listened to some Ramones and The Smiths. I played trivia with other passengers â€“ I came in 3rd place out of 3 players. I normally dread longer flights, but having satellite TV and Linux serving up entertainment really made the trip go by quickly.
