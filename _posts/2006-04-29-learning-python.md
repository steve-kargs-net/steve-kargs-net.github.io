Last year I started teaching my son Joshua, who was 10 years old at the time, to learn the programming language of [Python](http://www.python.org/). I had searched for and researched a [Kids Programming Language](http://www.kidsprogramminglanguage.com/), and settled on Python and the [Livewires course](http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/). Python promotes good programming practices, the language and its tools are available for free on many platforms and operating systems, and the language can be used to develop [some serious software](http://www.python.org/about/success/). The Livewires course includes [a series of worksheets and reference sheets](http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/pdfsheets.html) that culminate in the skills necessary to write a game.

I decided that I wanted to learn to program Python too, so a friend of mine suggested reading [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/), *<span class="application"></span>*a <span class="application">Python</span> book for experienced programmers. You can [buy a printed copy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593561/ref%3Dnosim/diveintomark20), [read it online](http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html), or [download it](http://diveintopython.org/#download "Download Dive Into Python") in a variety of formats.

Setting up Python is easy on most operating systems, and it came already installed on [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/). There are lots of libraries and frameworks for Python, including [pyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) and [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/). There are free and open source development environments that make editing and running your programs easy â€“ I like [DrPython](http://drpython.sourceforge.net/).

I also want to write a BACnet workstation client using Python, and my friend Joel donated some [core BACnet code that is written in Python](http://bacpypes.sourceforge.net/) just for doing that. Hopefully I will be up to speed soon on programming Python and will be able to create some demos for the project.
