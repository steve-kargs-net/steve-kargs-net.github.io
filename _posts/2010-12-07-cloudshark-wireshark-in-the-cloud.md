[![Clouds from an Airplane](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_9824-150x150.jpg "Clouds from an Airplane")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_9824.jpg)A post on the [Wireshark ](http://wireshark.org/)developers mailing list showed up at the beginning of December, 2010, about the [Cloudshark.org](http://cloudshark.org/) website. Cloudshark is a website that allows you to view Wireshark captures online. The captures can be in any capture format that Wireshark or [T-Shark](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html) supports. The site also allows linking to captures by using “http://cloudshark.org/view?url=” as the URL. Here are a couple captures that I have stored at my [kargs.net/captures/](http://kargs.net/captures/) site:
