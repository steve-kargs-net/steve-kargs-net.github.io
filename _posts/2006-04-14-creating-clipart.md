I am not an artist â€“ I am an engineer. But I would like to be an artist. I like using [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) and [Sodipodi](http://www.sodipodi.com/index.php3) to create SVG art images. SVG, [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg), is an open standard. The SVG images are nice because you can scale them and print them without them losing any sharpness or curves.![Easter Eggs](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/easter_eggs1.jpg "Easter Eggs")

I created some cartoon bubbles or balloons with Inkscape and submitted them to [Open Clipart](http://www.openclipart.org/). Today I created some Easter Eggs and submitted them. Then I decided to write up a [Tutorial about how I created the Easter Eggs](http://kargs.net/docs/easter_egg_tutorial.svg).  
Happy Easter!
