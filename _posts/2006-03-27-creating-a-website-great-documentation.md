I created a website the other day for a local parental support group called [GeorgiaFaces.info](http://georgiafaces.info/). First, I registered the domain with [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com/). Then, I pointed the domains nameservers at the [bluehost.com](http://bluehost.com/) nameservers instead of the parked pages. Then, after waiting a couple of hours for propagation to occur, I installed [PHPWebsite](http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/) at that domain using the Fantastico installer.

[PHPWebsite has great documentation](http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/man/html/). It doesn’t have WYSIWYG article editing. However, I was able to setup and configure the site, install themes, add events to the calendar, add menu items, create a links list, and get the site looking great in a very short time (a couple of evenings and an afternoon). All thanks to the great documentation. It makes me want to go and write great documentation for the projects I have worked on.

<span class="tt-flickr">![Jigsaw Puzzle](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/jigsaw_puzzle.jpg "Jigsaw Puzzle")</span>

I needed to add some character to the site, and some clipart or photos would do the trick. I prefer to use open source content, so I went to [OpenClipart](http://openclipart.org/) and [Burning Well](http://www.burningwell.org/). I found some nice Springtime clipart and adorned the site. I also found some clipart that wasn’t quite what I wanted, but after a few hours with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/), I transformed the jigsaw puzzle piece into a mini jigsaw puzzle.
