[![](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0947-150x150.jpg "BACnet_Meeting_Atlanta_2009")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0947.jpg)I attended the [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/) Committee and working group meetings in November, 2009, in Atlanta, Georgia. During the MS/TP working group meeting, it was disclosed that [KMC](http://www.kmccontrols.com/) had applied for a [patent which invents automatic MAC addressing for MS/TP devices](http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=wH_JAAAAEBAJ&dq=bacnet+mstp). It was surprising and disappointing to me, since the BACnet MS/TP working group had been working on standardizing [several mechanisms to allow automatic MAC addressing](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/bacnet-mstpwg/files/CG-005-1-MSTP%20Auto-Addr.doc) since early 2008.
