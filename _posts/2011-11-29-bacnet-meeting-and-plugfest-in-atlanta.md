I went to the BACnet meetings in Atlanta in October, 2011. A couple of weeks later in November, 2011, I went to the BACnet Plugfest in Atlanta. Lots of fun!

The Lighting Applications working group met for a couple of days, and crafted responses to the public review comments for our Lighting Output object. We also got the draft for the next pubic review done, and it should be reviewed with only substantive changes. Good news for this object that has been in the works for many, many years. We also crafted public review responses for the Channel object and the WriteGroup service, and drafted a subsequent review document.

Coleman, Dave, Dana, Don, and I ate at the Tin Drum restaurant for lunch. Delicious!

The BACnet meetings were again held in the spacious Georgia Tech Technology Square Research Building.

I brought a [WattStopper DLM](http://wattstopper.com/DLM/ "WattStopper DLM") setup for the BACnet International Plugfest, held at the Westin hotel in Atlanta. It’s always fun to have bright lights controlled by a BACnet universal dimmer! I presented a workshop on the work that the Lighting Applications working group has been doing, with some tips for developers. It was titled [“New BACnet objects and services have been proposed to support lighting control. What can you do with them? What can you do to prepare your devices?”](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BACnet_Lighting-Steve_Karg.zip)
