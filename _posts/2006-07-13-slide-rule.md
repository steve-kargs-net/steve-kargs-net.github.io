[![Foot faces sculpture](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/foot-faces.thumbnail.jpg "Foot faces sculpture")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/foot-faces.jpg)I was telling a friend about [Scilab](http://scilabsoft.inria.fr/), the free numerical analysis tool, and came across a [university page describing other numerical tools](http://www.engineering.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Software_Calculators/Calculators.htm), such as the [slide rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule). There is even a society that is dedicated to the preservation and history of slide rules and other calculating instruments â€“ [Oughtred Society](http://www.oughtred.org/). I think I may have used a slide rule once. I came across some [Slide Rule Operating Instructions](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/slide-rule-instructions.pdf) in a box of papers that my dad had, and scanned them for posterity.
