[![](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jeri-ellsworth-ESC-2011-150x150.jpg "jeri-ellsworth-ESC-2011")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jeri-ellsworth-ESC-2011.jpg)I had [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/) meetings the week of May 2, 2011, in San Francisco. It also happened that the Embedded Systems Conference was the same week in [San Jose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California). I perused my BACnet meeting schedule, and found that I could attend the Embedded Systems Conference on Thursday morning, which would enable me to see the exhibits, and also hear the keynote from [Jeri Ellsworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeri_Ellsworth).

My flight to San Francisco from Birmingham went through Houston. In Houston, I got to ride the [Automated People Mover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TerminaLink) train between concourses, always a highlight on my trips since I worked on these vehicles at several airport and downtown systems for [Westinghouse Transportation Systems](http://www.bombardier.com/) from 1992-1997. The train performed flawlessly – perfect programmed stop, smooth acceleration, and very little jerk. Much to my delight, San Francisco Airport also had [Automated People Mover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTrain_(SFO)) trains, and they also worked very well to get me to the rental car garage.

The BACnet meetings were held at the [The Pacific Energy Center](http://www.pge.com/pec) in downtown San Francisco. We discussed the Property\_List property for objects, the Zero Config algorithm for MS/TP MAC addressing, and the You-Are service for address and device ID assignment. More importantly, we celebrated [Cinqo de Mayo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo) at [Chevy’s](http://www.chevys.com/).

On Thursday I arrived at the Embedded Systems Conference a little early, and got to meet Jeri in her [motion activated Light Emitting Dress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLFLwZ-JGaU) before her talk. After the keynote, I toured the exhibits and picked up several new development kits from microcontroller vendors. The nice surprise was to see my STM32 Challenge contest entry displayed at the STM exhibit. I didn’t win, but I had fun. The S[TM32 Design Challenge entry](http://www.stm32challenge.com/detail/422) was just a simple port of my [BACnet Protocol Stack](http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/) to the [STM32F103](http://www.st.com/stm32) ARM Cortex M3 XL-Density Performance Line microcontroller with 1 MByte of embedded Flash and 96K SRAM. I also created a printed circuit board to attach to the STM32 Discovery Kit so that I could integrate RS-485, LEDs, and a DIP switch.
