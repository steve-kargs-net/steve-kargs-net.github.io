I listened to the [Dave Ramsey](http://daveramsey.com/) Show today while driving across town. [Amy Grant](http://amygrant.com/) was his guest. They talked about a way to give by sharing a story: [Spread The Sharing – Giving a Million meals](http://www.spreadthesharing.com/) through [Second Harvest](http://www.secondharvest.org/) food bank. Share a story on the [Spread the Sharing](http://www.spreadthesharing.com/) website and [Country Crock](http://www.countrycrock.com/) will donate a meal to America’s Second Harvest.
