I learned the Personal Software Process from [<font size="-1">**A Discipline for Software Engineering**</font>](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/books/tsp-psp/discipline-sw-eng-complete-psp.html) during lunchtime at work in 1996. During the course, the student is required to write some programs that perform statistical analysis of their data from writing the programs. I remember struggling to figure out the numerical methods for the programs, and then I stumbled upon Appendix A. It contained all the numerical methods that were needed in nice, procedural form. I occasionally get email about [my Personal Software Process page](http://kargs.net/psp.html) where I have the programs and statistics posted from my experience. The most recent email asked about the [chitest.c](http://kargs.net/code/chitest.c) program, and what some of the results from the program meant. I had to dig out my book, and found Appendix A again, where all the nitty gritty details are explained. Ah, the memories.

I now mostly use [Extreme Programming](http://www.xprogramming.com/) key practices instead of the data driven methods of PSP. Some day I’ll figure out [Model-View-Presenter](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html) and be able to automatically test my user interfaces. Maybe someday I’ll even figure out how use [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/) to test my embedded systems.
