[![jigsaw_green_02.gif](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/jigsaw_green_02.gif "jigsaw_green_02.gif")](http://steve.kargs.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/jigsaw_green_02.svg)I helped create [an Autism support group website](http://georgiafaces.info/) several months ago. I needed some Autism related clipart and tried to find some of the colorful jigsaw puzzle pieces that are often found on Autism related sites and accessories. I didnâ€™t find any that were suitable or in the public domain and decided to create my own. I found a single puzzle piece on the OpenClipart website. The [OpenClipart website](http://www.openclipart.org/) has lots of public domain clipart in [SVG format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG).

Using [Inkscape, a free and open source graphics illustration application](http://www.inkscape.org/), I fit four single puzzle pieces together and colored them. Then I fit those four pieces together until I had a small mat of puzzle pieces. I tried to match the color scheme with an Autism ribbon that I had seen. I exported the small mat into [PNG format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG). I used the [GIMP, a free and open source image manipulation tool](http://www.gimp.org/), to add several of these together. I ended up with an autism puzzle background that I could create shapes or [words in using the GIMP and masks](http://www.gimptalk.com/forum/topic/3-Ways-To-Put-An-Image-In-Your-Text-163-1.html).

I never did use the words on the website. I did use the small four puzzle piece on the website. The Autism puzzle piece also seems to be a popular search term for that site.
