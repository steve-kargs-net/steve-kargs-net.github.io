Here are the best of breed – my favorite [cross-platform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_platform) applications.

I use [LibreOffice.org](http://LibreOffice.org/) software for word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and drawings. I also use [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps) for collaborative work.

I use [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) Firefox or Google [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) for browsing.

A nice, full featured graphical text editor with syntax highlighting and many other bells and whistles is [Vim](http://vim.sourceforge.net/), or Vi IMproved – a programmers text editor. I mainly use [SciTe](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) which is based on [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/). For source code compilers, I use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), [WinAVR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/) (avr-gcc), and [Yagarto](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yagarto/) (GNU-ARM). I sometimes use [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), the cross platform cross-platform IDE built around [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/).

I like a full featured graphics and photograph editing tool called [the GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) – the GNU Image Manipulation Program. I use [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) for creating and editing scalable vector graphics.

If you like to play or edit sound, [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is a good, simple audio editor suitable for recording, mixing, and editing ordinary tracks of CD-quality audio. [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/) is a free cross-platform media player that supports a large number of multimedia formats without the need for additional codecs.

Games I enjoy playing are [Tux Racer](http://tuxracer.sourceforge.net/), [BZFlag](http://www.bzflag.org/), [Chromium BSU](http://chromium-bsu.sourceforge.net/), [Nethack](http://www.nethack.org/), [Never Ball](http://icculus.org/neverball/), and [Critical Mass](http://criticalmass.sourceforge.net/). There are lots of games, such as [Tux Paint](http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/), written using the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](http://libsdl.org/), an open source, cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide fast access to the graphics framebuffer and audio device.

An open source, cross-platform native UI framework is [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) (formerly called wxWindows).

There are some applications that are useful on Win32 where an equivalent application is already included in any major Linux distribution. I use [FileZilla](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/) for FTP client and FTP server, wheras on [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/) Linux I use [Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org/) for an FTP client and [vsftpd](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/) for an FTP server. I use [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) for an SSH client on Windows, and [Konsole](http://konsole.kde.org/) on [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/). I use [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/) for a secure shell file manager under Windows, and [Konqueror](http://www.konqueror.org/) under [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/). I use [TortoiseSVN ](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)and [TortoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) and [TortoiseHG](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) for source code control, and mostly command line svn or cvs or hg or git clients under [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). [PDF Creator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/) is a tool for creating PDF documents just by printing them from any Windows application. To compare or “diff” files, I use [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) on Windows, [Kompare](http://www.caffeinated.me.uk/kompare/) on Kubuntu, or [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) on Ubuntu. I use [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) for archiving on Windows.
