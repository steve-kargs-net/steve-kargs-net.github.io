My name is [Steve Karg](http://kargs.net/), and I write [software](http://steve.kargs.net/category/software/) (aka firmware) for a living. I thought I should dedicate some web space for the things I do. I mostly write embedded C for PC and microcontroller based controllers, but I have dabbled in a few other areas as well.

I am passionate about writing high quality software, and enjoy using [Extreme Programming](http://xprogramming.org/) key practices.

I participate in an international standard for building automation and control networking called [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/ "BACnet"). I even wrote an [open source BACnet protocol stack](http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/). I wrote some of the BACnet dissector code in [Wireshark](http://wireshark.org/), and help maintain it. My [PDF resume](http://www.kargs.net/docs/stk-resume.pdf) or [Linked In profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skarg) show other things that I have done for work.

I contribute to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) as the user [Skarg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Skarg). I use [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) on the desktop at home and occasionally work, and run [Debian Linux](http://www.debian.org/) file, mail, and web servers at home and work. I have created a number of websites, and am the webmaster for several non-profit groups.

I am also an avid amateur photographer. You can see my work in my blog, on my [website](http://kargs.net/wallpaper/), at [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skarg/), on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Skarg/gallery), or at [tookapic](https://tookapic.com/skarg). I used to have a darkroom as a kid, and have had many cameras through the years. I shoot digital now. I also like creating [clipart](http://steve.kargs.net/category/clipart/) and drawing with [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and contribute my work to the [Open Clipart Project](http://openclipart.org/) and [Tux Paint](http://tuxpaint.org/).
